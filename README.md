This data is looking at dog bite incidents in New York. I found this data on the NYC Open Data site (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg/about_data)
and it was provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I am interested in this data because I am a dog lover and genuinely curious on the topic. This data provides the date,
breed, age, zipcode, borough, and whether the dog was spayed/neutered. One qualitative column is the gender of the dog in the incident and two quantitative are the age of the 
dog and the date the incident occured.
