To clean my data I first changed the "Date" column into a datetime. I then dropped the columns that I felt weren't necessary to the research. Finally, I got rid of the any missing
rows of data for the "Sighter Observed Weather Data" and "Other Animal Sightings" columns.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
squirrels = pd.read_csv("Central_Park.csv", na_values = ("NaN"))
squirrels.head()
squirrels.dtypes
squirrels["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(squirrels["Date"])
squirrels.head()
squirrels.dtypes
squirrels = squirrels.drop(columns = ["Litter", "Litter Notes", "Hectare Conditions Notes"])
dup_filter = squirrels.duplicated()
squirrels[dup_filter]
len(squirrels)
squirrels.describe(include = ["O"])
missing_rows = squirrels["Sighter Observed Weather Data"].isna()
squirrels2 = squirrels[~ missing_rows]
squirrels2.head()
missing_rows2 = squirrels2["Other Animal Sightings"].isna()
squirrels2 = squirrels2[~ missing_rows2]
squirrels2.head()
